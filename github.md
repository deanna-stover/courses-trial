# Github/Jekyll Blog Tutorial

## What even is GitHub/Jekyll?

GitHub is a code hosting platform for versioning (meaning keeping track of changes in code) and collaboration. But that's not what we'll be using it for. We'll be using Jekyll to create a static blog with no need for a hosting service, so it is free! 

You'll be using something called [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/) to write your posts. It's really quite simple! It's not coding per se, but it does convert your styling to HTML for display on your website. It takes a little patience to learn the ins and outs of Markdown, but by the end of the semester, it will be second nature!

GitHub uses *repositories* to organize projects. You'll be creating *one* repository for your project, since this will be a blog. There's a lot you can do with the repository features in GitHub, but we'll be keeping things pretty simple.

## Before you begin . . .

. . . you will need a GitHub account. If you don't have one yet, [sign up here](https://github.com/). Remember, when you're choosing your GitHub username, keep in mind FERPA (see the statement on the syllabus) and keep it professional and appropriate. Also, keep the name as simple as you can.
