## General Overview

Twitter is pretty popular in the Digital Humanities community and has been for awhile. It's also a good way of practicing being concise and informative while talking to a public audience. You'll be setting up an *academic* or *professional* Twitter, meaning you might need to create a new profile if you already have a personal account. If you're unfamiliar with Twitter, [check this out](https://digitalhumanities.berkeley.edu/twitter-scholarly-networking). 

You should be **posting on Twitter *twice* per week** and then **submitting Tweets to me via Scholar each Sunday by 11:59 pm**. To submit your Tweets via Scholar, you'll need to take screen shots. I've listed some resources and instructions below. I've also included instructions for sumbitting your tweets under "How to Submit."
