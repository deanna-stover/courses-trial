## General Overview

In many ways, we’re trapped in our own yellow wallpapered room because of the pandemic, but that doesn't mean we can't write something that at the very least attempts to make a difference. For this assignment you'll create a Twine game about a social issue (current or historical), but you can be creative about how you tell the story. 

What is Twine? Twine is kind of like a Choose Your Own Adventure novel. It's an interactive hypertext storytelling medium. We'll be learning how to use Twine and some (very!) basic HTML and CSS to help customize the game.

You’ll also need to do research for your Twine game. Yay! You’ll write a project proposal and then an annotated bibliography before you get too deep into the Twine game so I can make sure you’re headed in the right direction. You’ll also write a relatively short research paper that discusses the choices you made in your Twine game and how it relates back to the research you completed.

Some topic ideas: 
* Women’s suffrage in the U.S. or U.K. (this year is the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage in the U.S. btw)
* Black Lives Matter 
* The Pandemic (or illnesses from history)
* First Generation college students
* Mass incarceration 
* Digital Humanities and anything related to gender, race, (dis)ability, and/or sexuality. 
* Underfunded schools/communities
* LGTBQ rights (historical as in the case of Oscar Wilde or in recent memory)
* AI and anything related to gender, race, (dis)ability, and/or sexuality.

## Assignment Breakdown

### - Proposal - Week 8 (10/5 - 10/7)

Instead of having class on Monday and Wednesday of Week 8 (October 5th and 7th), I'll be holding individual meetings about your topic proposal. You'll need to turn in your proposal via Scholar *before* our meeting. This is where we'll discuss your choice of subject and come up with some ideas for moving forward. We'll be looking at some sample proposals in class, but your proposal should be **150-300 words**. 

### - Annotated Bibliography - Sunday, October 18th at 11:59 pm
