## General Overview

First of all, Twine is kind of like a Choose Your Own Adventure novel. It's an interactive hypertext storytelling medium. We'll be learning how to use Twine and how to customize it using some basic HTML and CSS.

In many ways we’re trapped in our own yellow wallpapered room because of the pandemic, but that doesn't mean we can't write something that at the very least attempts to make a difference. Like Stetson, we'll be writing for change. For this assignment you'll create a Twine game about a social issue (current or historical--after all, history informs the present), but you can be creative about how you tell the story. 

You’ll write a project proposal and then an annotated bibliography before you get too deep into the Twine game so I can make sure you’re headed in the right direction and to guarantee your game is grounded in research. You’ll also write a short research paper that discusses the choices you made in your Twine game and how it relates back to the research you completed. 

Combined, the game and paper equal 30% of your grade, but think of the game as worth 15% and the research paper as worth another 15%. Not quite so intimidating then, hopefully! 

Some topic ideas (but this list certainly isn't exhaustive!): 
* Women’s suffrage in the U.S. or U.K. (this year is the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage in the U.S. btw)
* Black Lives Matter 
* The Pandemic (or illnesses from history)
* First Generation college students
* Mass incarceration 
* Digital Humanities and anything related to gender, race, (dis)ability, and/or sexuality
* Underfunded schools/communities
* LGTBQ rights (historical as in the case of Oscar Wilde or in recent memory)
* AI and anything related to gender, race, (dis)ability, and/or sexuality
* Immigration 

I do expect you to do academic research that backs up the choices your player is given in the game itself, so please don't choose a topic if you are unwilling to have your beliefs questioned. I also want everyone to be respectful and kind to their classmaes, so be aware of the language and framing you use when addressing controversial topics.

## Assignment Breakdown

### - Proposal - Week 8 (10/19 - 10/21)

Instead of having class on Monday and Wednesday of Week 8, I'll be holding individual meetings about your topic proposal. You'll need to turn in your proposal via Scholar *before* our meeting. This is where we'll discuss your choice of subject and come up with some ideas for moving forward. Your proposal should be **200-300 words** and explain both your topic and its social relevance.  

*I will not accept the other portions of this assignment until your proposal has been approved.* 

### - Annotated Bibliography - Sunday, November 1st at 11:59 pm

You'll be responsible for finding *at least* five (5) academic sources and writing **100-150 words per entry** explaining the central argument of the source and its relevance to your project (i.e. how you plan to use it).

The Annotated Bibliography should be formatted according to **MLA** guidelines. 

### - Final Twine Game and Research Paper Deadline - Friday, December 11th at 11:59 pm

Your playable Twine game should have the following:
* At least fifteen player interactions
* At least three possible outcomes
* Some (basic) CSS and HTML

In addition to your Twine game, you must write a **1000-1250 word** research essay. This essay will tie your research back to the choices you made in creating your Twine game, so you should be citing at least five academic sources in your paper.
