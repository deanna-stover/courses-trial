## Assignment Breakdown

_____

## Evaluation Criteria

* I will grade your tweets each week as Pass/Fail based on completion. *However*, I may occasionally give some short feedback on improving your tweets. This is important because you'll be using your tweets (and maybe even tweets from other people in class or from anyone, really, but I digress) in your Final Reflection. You'll be *required* to use some of your own tweets in that reflection, so take your tweets seriously!
