# Final Reflection

_____

**Final Reflection Due:** Thursday, December 17th between 5:00 and 7:30 pm <br />
**Percentage:** 10%

_____

## General Overview

Drawing on the entire semester, you will create a media essay using Wakelet that incorporates tweets, readings, and links from class along with your reflections on your own work throughout the semester, the course as a whole, and the Digital Humanities more broadly. 
_____

## Assignment Breakdown

You will be writing a **500+ word** reflection. When you’re done, **share your Collection** (create a shareable link you’ll send to me) *and* **export to PDF** (to submit via Scholar) by our Finals time slot.

Some additional notes:

* You are *required* to use *at least **five tweets*** whether they are your own, someone else's from class, or from Twitter more broadly

* If you link to an article we read in class (or that we didn't!), make sure to discuss it


## What you should NOT do

* Please don't mention your grades. It's not necessary and it puts you in a vulnerable spot. Instead, you can talk about how an assignment was difficult for you or how much fun you had doing a certain project. No grades. It's just not worth it and it puts both of us in a weird position.

* Please don't quote my feedback. That's something personal between the two of us. You can, however, talk about how my feedback was helpful as you moved forward or how you felt that you needed more guidance at a particular point. 

* This isn't a rant or a gloat. If you had problems with the class, save that for your reviews of me and the course. You can be critical of readings, though. If you loved a particular assignment or the course as a whole, that's great (really great!), but think critically about it too.

_____

## Evaluation Criteria

* Uses adequate **textual evidence** (direct quotations, summaries, paraphrased passages) including tweets and readings from the course

* **Thinks critically** about the class, individual work, and the Digital Humanities more broadly

* **Organizes ideas** -- basically, the reflection should make sense as a whole rather than as bits and pieces

* Takes advantage and **customizes** the Wakelet platform 

* Utilizes proper **mechanics**; style, sentence structure, and spelling promote coherence, clarity, and credibility

* **Cites** appropriately -- but yes, for the articles and tweets you link to directly, don't worry about citations
