## General Overview

Over the next several weeks, we will be working on writing a grant that proposes a digital humanities project. You are not responsible for *completing* the project, but you are responsible for a proposal and several components that flesh out the project (i.e. a Grant Narrative, Environmental Scan, Budget, CV or Resume, and a Bibliography). Grants are a huge part of the digital humanities field, and being able to know what goes into a grant will be helpful in many other fields as well. Plus, this is a time for creativity! This is about what *you* want to develop within the field of DH!

If you choose, you can work in teams of two for this project. 

Remember, there will be **two blog process blog posts due as you write the grant.** These blog posts are detailed in the [Blog Prompt](https://deanna-stover.github.io/coursesCNU/2020/engl350fall2020/blog-posts) and are due Friday, November 20th and Friday, December 11th.

## Proposal - Week 9 (10/26 - 10/30)

Instead of having class during Week 9, I'll be holding individual meetings about your topic proposal. You'll need to turn in your proposal via Scholar before our meeting. This is where we'll discuss your choice of subject for the grant and come up with some ideas for moving forward. Your proposal should be 200-300 words and describe your ideal digital humanities project. This can incorporate your area of study, of course, as long as it has humanistic (and digital!) elements. So, this can't just be a pitch for a research paper--there needs to be some sort of digital component planned (again, not executed, but planned).

Some ideas (note that this list is not exhaustive):
* A mapping project for a short story, novel, or travelogue
* A digital edition of a text (the more creative you can get with this, the better) -- and remember, editions should deal with something out of copyright and in the public domain.
* A 3D modeling or printing project (critical making could also work here--bringing Arduino or something similar to the classroom)
* Some sort of network analysis or visualization (looking at how actors are connected in old films, for instance, or looking at Twitter, Instagram, etc.)
* A podcast about DH
* A born digital creative project

*I will not accept the final grant until your proposal has been approved.*
