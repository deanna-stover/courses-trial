_____


# About Me

This is the shortest of you blog posts. You are required to write **250-500 words** describing your academic self (with enough about the personal that makes you feel comfortable, keeping in mind the [FERPA notice](https://deanna-stover.github.io/coursesCNU/2020/engl350fall2020/##ferpa) on the syllabus). 

# Coding

In this blog, you'll write **500-750 words** explaining the process of coding our text and reflecting on the final outcome. This can be about the difficulties you faced or something interesting you found in the reading. You'll also explain any coding decisions you made. Include ***at least* two images**, one of which shows your TEI on paper. 

# Review

Based on the reviews you read in preparation, write a review of a digital project you found. Remember that you can be critical and still polite or impressed but still evaluative. This blog should be **500-750 words**. 

# Grant Process One

In this **500-750 word** blog, share your project with the rest of the class (and update me!). How has the research been going? Do you still imagine your project like you did when you first wrote your abstract? 

# Grant Process Two

Now that you're nearing the end of your grant project, write a **500-750 word** blog post that explains your nearly-finalized project. Has anything changed since your last process post? If not, what have your developed further? How has the process of writing a grant changed your understanding of the project as a whole?
