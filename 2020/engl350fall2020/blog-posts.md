## General Overview

You will write five blogs over the course of the semester using Jekyll/GitHub. To get started, make sure you complete [Dr. Andrew Pilsch's tutorial](https://oncomouse.github.io/courses/2020/engl460fall2020/jekyll-intro). 

We'll be doing several different kinds of posts on the blog, the details for which are below. 

_____


# About Me

This is the shortest of your blog posts. You will write **250-500 words** describing your academic self (with enough about the personal that makes you feel comfortable, keeping in mind the FERPA notice on the syllabus). If you go over the word limit, that's fine! But try and be concise. 

You should be using some [markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) to format your posts, whether that's inserting links or simply emphasizing words.

Some ideas to get you started, but you can write anything as long as it is appropriate:

* Your year in school
* Your preferred pronouns
* Your interest in the course
  * Your interest/enrollment in the DH minor
  * Pursuing a carreer in writing
  * Fulfilling a WI requirement . . . and (hopefully!) wanting to become a better writer
* Carreer interests (writing or otherwise)
  * Do you want to go to graduate school? Or enter a career right after graduation? What are your dreams?
* Academic or personal successes
  * Have you volunteered anywhere?
  * Have you been a Summer Scholar? An intern? Etc.
  * Do you belong to any societies? Academic or otherwise . . . 
* Some personal tidbits
  * Hometown
  * Pets
  * Fandoms you belong to

Also, feel free to add a picture of yourself, although it's not required (again, see the information about FERPA on the syllabus). To insert a picture, simply do the following:

_____

# Review

Based on the reviews you read in preparation, write a review of a digital project you found. Remember that you can be critical and still polite or appreciative but still evaluative. This blog should be **500-750 words**. 

Some general guidelines: you must find a review a digital humaniites project, not just an article or book on DH. You might find a mapping project or a digital edition (note that this is different than an electronic text) or really anything you think qualifies as DH. If you're having trouble finding something or telling whether what you've found qualifies as DH, bring your issue up in class or visit me during Office Hours. 

Include ***at least* one image** of the project you're reviewing. 

_____

# Coding

In this blog, you'll write **500-750 words** explaining the process of coding our text and reflecting on the final outcome. This can be about the difficulties you faced or something interesting you found in the reading. You'll also explain any coding decisions you made. 

Include ***at least* two images**, one of which shows your TEI on paper and one of which shows your computer code. 

_____

# Grant Process One

In this **500-750 word** blog, share your project with the rest of the class (and update me!). 

A few questions to get you started:

* How has the research been going? 
* Do you still imagine your project like you did when you first wrote your abstract?
* Have you found any other DH projects that are similar to yours? How are you differentiating your project from them?

_____

# Grant Process Two

Now that you're nearing the end of your grant project, write a **500-750 word** blog post that explains your nearly-finalized project. 

A few questions to get you started:

* Has anything changed since your last process post? 
* If not, what have your developed further? 
* How has the process of writing a grant changed your understanding of the project as a whole?

_____

## (General) Evaluation Criteria

* **Thinks critically** whether you're writing a review or a process post or just introducing yourself

* Shows **professionalism** â€“ i.e. that you took this assignment seriously

* Presents information in an **organized** and coherent way

* **Follows instructions** for the appropriate blog post

* Utilizes proper **mechanics**; style, sentence structure, and spelling promote coherence, clarity, and credibility
