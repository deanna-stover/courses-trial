## General Overview

You will write five blogs over the course of the semester using Jekyll/GitHub. To get started, make sure you complete [Dr. Andrew Pilsch's tutorial](https://oncomouse.github.io/courses/2020/engl460fall2020/jekyll-intro). 

We'll be doing several different kinds of posts on the blog, the details for which are below. Check out "How to Submit" to figure out how to turn in your assignment to Scholar.

# About Me

This is the shortest of your blog posts. You will write **250-500 words** describing your academic self (with enough about the personal that makes you feel comfortable, keeping in mind the FERPA notice on the syllabus). If you go over the word limit, that's fine! But try and be concise. 

You should be using some [markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) to format your posts, whether that's inserting links and images or simply emphasizing words. **Update**: some students wanted more guidance, so please use *at least* five instances of markdown.

Some ideas to get you started, but you can write anything as long as it is appropriate:

* Your year in school
* Your preferred pronouns
* Your interest in the course
  * Your interest/enrollment in the DH minor
  * Pursuing a carreer in writing
  * Fulfilling a WI requirement . . . and (hopefully!) wanting to become a better writer
* Carreer interests (writing or otherwise)
  * Do you want to go to graduate school? Or enter a career right after graduation? What are your dreams?
* Academic or personal successes
  * Have you volunteered anywhere?
  * Have you been a Summer Scholar? An intern? Etc.
  * Do you belong to any societies? Academic or otherwise . . . 
* Some personal tidbits
  * Hometown
  * Pets
  * Fandoms you belong to

Also, feel free to add a picture of yourself, although it's not required (again, see the information about FERPA on the syllabus). To insert a picture, simply do the following:

## Step One:

The first thing you need to do is create an images folder. You do this by going to Add File then Create New File. You will then type in `images/profile.md` (or whatever--the important part is the images/. You can delete the .md file later. It's just there so that you have a folder.) Don't forget to Commit your changes.

![Step One](https://deanna-stover.github.io/coursesCNU/images/stepone.gif)

## Step Two:

Once you've created the folder, make sure you're in the `images` folder the click Add File then Upload Files. You can then drag and drop your picture into GitHub. Don't forget to Commit.

Tips: 
1. You want to name your photo rather than leave it a string of letters or numbers. The title will be the link you use. I chose "Profile.jpg" because it is my profile picture.
2. Make sure your image is smaller than my gigantic one, but good quality. 

![Step Two](https://deanna-stover.github.io/coursesCNU/images/steptwo.gif)

## Step Three:

To add your image into your blog, first go to your `_posts` folder then to the appropriate post. Once you click the edit button (the pencil), you can type `![Alt Text](link)` (filling in the blanks as appropriate. Your link should be the path to the image. So username.github.io/repositoryname/images/imagetitle.filetype. Don't forget to commit. 

![Step Three](https://deanna-stover.github.io/coursesCNU/images/stepthree.gif)

And remember, always check to see if the image is showing up on your actual blog, not just the preview in GitHub. If it's not, you're using the wrong link (tip: if your link has "blob" or "github.com" in it, you're using the wrong link. Instead, you need to use the path that looks something like this: https://deanna-stover.github.io/deanna-stover/images/Profile.jpg).

# Review

Based on the reviews you read in preparation, write a review of a digital project you found. Remember that you can be critical and still polite or appreciative but still evaluative. This blog should be **500-750 words**. 

Some general guidelines: you must find and review a digital humanities project, not just an article or book on DH. You might find a mapping project or a digital edition (note that this is different than an electronic text) or really anything you think qualifies as DH. If you're having trouble finding something or telling whether what you've found qualifies as DH, bring your issue up in class (we have some time for that scheduled on Friday, September 18th) or visit me during Office Hours. 

Please do not review a project that has already been reviewed in *Reviews in DH*.

Once you've figured out the project you'd like to review, "claim" it in our Shared Google Drive. Try and pick something that other people have not yet claimed. 

Include ***at least* one image** of the project you're reviewing. But if your project is extra complex, remember, you may need more.

**Tip**: Check out the ["Review Content"](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/review-process) section from *Reviews in DH* to get some more ideas for what a review entails.

# Coding

In this blog, you'll write **500-750 words** explaining the process of coding our text and reflecting on the final outcome. This can be about the difficulties you faced or something interesting you found in the reading. You'll also explain any coding decisions you made. 

Include ***at least* two images**, one of which shows your TEI on paper and one of which shows your computer code. 

_____

# Grant Process One

In this **500-750 word** blog, share your project with the rest of the class (and update me!). 

A few questions to get you started:

* How has the research been going? 
* Do you still imagine your project like you did when you first wrote your abstract?
* Have you found any other DH projects that are similar to yours? How are you differentiating your project from them?

_____

# Grant Process Two

Now that you're nearing the end of your grant project, write a **500-750 word** blog post that explains your nearly-finalized project. 

A few questions to get you started:

* Has anything changed since your last process post? 
* If not, what have your developed further? 
* How has the process of writing a grant changed your understanding of the project as a whole?

_____

## How to Submit

To find the URL for your blog, you'll need to go to Settings on GitHub, scroll down to "GitHub Pages", click the link, and then find your post. Once you've done that, simply copy and paste what is in the browser bar. 

Your URL should start with something like this: https://deanna-stover.github.io/ **NOT** like this: https://github.com/deanna-stover/

Under "Assignments" on Scholar, please use the Text Submission "Write Submission" button to enter the URL to your blog and then upload a screenshot of your code. You may need to choose the "soft wrap" option in order to see all of the text at once. This option is in the upper left hand corner of where you edit your file.

_____

## Late Work

**About Me**: Because I added the late policy after this due date, I will accept the About Me blog post with no penalty up to Wednesday, September 16th. Then I will start subtracting 10 points for every day your assignment is late.

**The Rest**: I will be subtracting 10 points for every day your assignment is late unless you've been been given an extension.

_____

## (General) Evaluation Criteria

* **Thinks critically** whether you're writing a review or a process post or just introducing yourself

* Shows **professionalism** â€“ i.e. that you took this assignment seriously

* Presents information in an **organized** and coherent way
