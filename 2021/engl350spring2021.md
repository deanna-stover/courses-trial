# Course Information

## Instructor - Dr. Deanna Stover

  **email:** deanna.stover@cnu.edu 

  **office hours:** MWF 10:15 - 11:30 am, F 3:00 - 3:45 pm, and by appointment
  
   *All office hours will be held online.*
   
   Office hours are your time to come talk to me about anything related (or unrelated) to class. This time is yours, I am not (supposed to be) doing anything else; you will not be interrupting me. If you have questions about class or have other questions I might be able to answer, please (virtually) drop by.
   
   Since social distancing in the classroom makes personal one-on-one conversations before and after class impossible, email and office hours will be even more critical this semester. Please make use of both.
   
## Course Description 

*Catalog Description*: This course examines online texts in the humanities, also called digital humanities, which is the study of information in electronic form. Throughout the semester students will study how media impact the humanities and the people who use the Internet and social software to disseminate information widely and immediately. Students will investigate and produce a range of digital rhetoric wikis, blogs, tweets, flicks, as well as nonfiction and fiction narratives produced exclusively for an online environment to understand how media affects writing and communication and how digital writing and communication affects media. 

## Learning Objectives

* Write for digital environments using a variety of platforms and develop specific skills, competencies, and points of view needed by digital humanists
* Find, evaluate, and use resources to explore a topic in depth and critique digital humanities projects
* Learn how to apply course materials to improve critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making 
* Use feedback to improve writing and practice expressing oneself professionally

# Policies

## A Note on Covid-19 and Attendance:

I want you to be in class, but I also understand that COVID-19 and everything that goes along with it (mental health, for one) are going to make this semester especially difficult. And, of course, life goes on so there is always the possibility of 2021 sending even more curve balls our way. Because of this, I won't have an attendance policy, *but* (and this is a big BUT), if you aren't present two class days in a row, I will be checking in on you. I want to know you're okay.

And, while there's no strict attendance policy, not coming to class will likely affect your grade. We'll be discussing important topics in class and going over assignments, so without it, you may struggle. This is all to say, *please* come to class if you can. However, if you feel ill in any way, it is imperative that you stay home. Please don't put your classmates or me at risk. 

## Technology:

Because we will be working a lot with technology, you should expect to spend time out of class familiarizing yourself with new technologies and software. I also encourage the *productive* use of technology in class, but please don't distract yourself or others. 

## Late Work:

For each day an assignment is late, I will be subtracting ten points. That said, if you need an extension, please do reach out to me before the deadline! Life gets complicated sometimes, especially right now. I'm happy to work with you! Just make sure you're talking to me *before* things are due. 

## FERPA:

The Family Educational Records and Privacy Act gives you a right to privacy in this class. In addition to governing where I can and cannot discuss grades and to whom I can disclose information about your class participation, FERPA also implies that I cannot force you to pubically disclose that you are a student in this class.

This means that if you choose to use your real name on your course blog (and as your GitHub account name) or on Twitter, you are waiving that portion of your FERPA rights and disclosing that you are a member of this class. If you would prefer to post using an alias or a handle for the blogging and tweeting portions of this course, you are protecting your right to privacy and are more than welcome to do so.

However, if you use an alias, please list your first name and last initial next to your Twitter handle and blog link in our class Google Drive so I know who you are.

I owe thanks to Andrew Pilsch for some of the language in this syllabus and for the code that helped to create it.
